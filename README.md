## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code - using HTML5 & CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- ZonerX (for viewing the supplied images)
- Paint.net (for creating the Screenshot image)
- GitHub Pages
- GitHub (still very un-intuitive, but I'm learning)

### What I learned

- This was a pretty simple design. Yet it was a good one to practice the basics.

- This project shows a black hand for the pointer in the 'active' design image. That was a challenge to replicate.

### Continued development

- DO NOT START CODING ON THE COMPUTER. Either print it out and makes notes on the printed page ordraw it out and make notes there. Then start writing the code by hand.
